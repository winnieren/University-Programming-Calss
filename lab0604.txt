For which method is it easier to write the code? Why?

It is easier to write the code through the recursive method because it was a simpler logic. Less constraints (if-else statements for different cases) were necessary.
Also, we are more accustomed to thinking of these mathematical questions recursively in real life
(we share a more similar formula as the recursive program for the fibonaci sequence, fn= f(n-1) + f(n-2), which is very similar to return = recusive (n-1)+recursive (n-2))


Which method is more computationally efficient? why?

The interative functions is more computationally efficient because recursive functions require more memory than the equivalent iterative version. Therefore, it takes the computer more time to run
